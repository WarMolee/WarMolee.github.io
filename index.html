					My name is Oskar Ternstr√∂m, I go by the tag "WarMole" on most online platforms. I currently live and study in Sweden. I am currently studdying to become a high school engineer in Helsingborg. I would see myself as a curious person, I enjoy both exploring and researching different topics and or activites. Getting to deep dive in obscure topics or thoughts is something I love doing. Most of my freetime I spend either with friends or playing my favorite online games, my favorites are the genres horror and puzzle games. I have dabbled in multiple hobbies but have yet to stick my teeth in anything. I usualy have lots of ideas or projects that I would love to attempt but either do not have the resources or knowledge to make them a reality.

								Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
